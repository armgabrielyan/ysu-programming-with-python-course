# Homework No. 01

**Due:** 23:59, 19 February, 2025

**Max points:** 100

## Rules

- **No late homeworks.** A penalty of 10 points is applied for each day.
- **No plagiarism.** Collaboration is encouraged, but copying someone else's work without proper attribution is not admitted and invalidates the submission. A penalty is applied to all parties included.
- **Responsible AI Use.** AI assistants (e.g. ChatGPT) may be used as a learning tool, but the primary goal of homework is to develop your own problem-solving and coding skills. AI should be used minimally and responsibly with proper understanding and attribution. Submissions that rely excessively on AI without demonstrating personal effort may receive penalties.

## Submission procedure

- A single Jupyter Notebook file can be used. The following naming convention should be used: `homework{number}_{student name}.ipynb`. For example, `homework01_John_Doe.ipynb`.
- At the start of the file, homework number and student full name should be mentioned. Problem solutions should be clearly separated by problem numbers. For example:

```python
"""
# Homework 01
## Name: Jane Dane

### Problem 1

...

### Problem 2

...
"""
```

- Solution files should be uploaded to [YSU Moodle](https://e-learning.ysu.am/). Alternatively, you can commit your solutions to a Git repository and provide the repository URL on Moodle.

## Problem 1 [10 points]  

Write a function `make_polynomial(*coefficients)` that takes an arbitrary number of coefficients and returns a function representing the polynomial. The returned function should compute the polynomialâ€™s value when called with a specific $x$.  

### Example  

```python
def make_polynomial(*coefficients):
    pass

poly = make_polynomial(2, 3, 5)  # Represents 2 + 3x + 5x^2
print(poly(0))  # 2
print(poly(1))  # 10
```

## Problem 2 [10 points]

Write a function that calculates the $n$-th derivative of a polynomial. The polynomial can be represented as a list of coefficients, where the index corresponds to the power of $x$. For example, $[3, 1, 2]$ represents the polynomial $3 + x + 2x^2$.  

### Example  

```python
def polynomial_nth_derivative(coefficients, n):
    pass

print(nth_derivative([3, 1, 2], 1))  # [1, 4] (Derivative of 3 + x + 2x^2 is 4x)
print(nth_derivative([3, 1, 2], 2))  # [4] (Second derivative is 4)
print(nth_derivative([3, 1, 2], 3))  # [0] (Third derivative is 0)
```

## Problem 3 [10 points]

Write a function `matrix_power(matrix, n)` that computes the $n$-th power of a given square matrix.  

- Assume $n$ is a non-negative integer.  
- If $n = 0$, return the identity matrix of the same size.  
- If $n = 1$, return the matrix itself.  
- For $n > 1$, compute the matrix product repeatedly.

### Example  

```python
def matrix_power(matrix, n):
    pass

matrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]

print(matrix_power(matrix, 3)) # [[37, 54], [81, 118]]
print(matrix_power(matrix, 0)) # [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
```

<!-- $$\pagebreak$$ -->

## Problem 4 [10 points]  

Write a function `compose(*funcs)` that takes an arbitrary number of single-argument functions and returns a new function that is the composition of the input functions. The composed function should apply each function in the order they were passed.  

### Example  

```python
def double(x):
    return x * 2

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

def square(x):
    return x * x

def compose(*funcs):
    pass

composed = compose(square, increment, double)
print(composed(3))  # square(increment(double(3))) = 49
```

## Problem 5 [10 points]

Write a Python recursive function to generate all possible combinations of a set of elements.

**Note:** This will be your implementation of `itertools.combinations` function.
**Note:** It is not required, but this function can be a generator function.

### Example

```python
def generate_combinations(elements, k):
    pass

elements = [1, 2, 3, 4]
k = 3
combinations = generate_combinations(elements, k)
print(combinations) # [(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4)]
```

## Problem 6 [10 points]

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For example, $6$ is a perfect number. 

Write a Python generator function that generates all the perfect numbers up to a given limit.

### Example

```python
def generate_perfect_numbers(limit):
    pass

for num in perfect_numbers(100):
    print(num, end=" ") # 6 28
```

## Problem 7 [10 points]

An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, $153$ is an Armstrong number as $153 = 1 ^ 3 + 5 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3$.

Write a Python generator function that generates all the Armstrong numbers up to a given limit.

### Example

```python
def generate_armstrong_numbers(limit):
    pass

for num in generate_armstrong_numbers(1000):
    print(num, end=" ") # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 153 370 371 407
```

## Problem 8 [10 points]

**Note:** The following problem can be solved using generator functions in the Python standard library.
 
Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of all the triples of numbers in the list that form a Pythagorean triplet.

### Example

```python
def pythagorean_triplets(numbers):
    pass

print(pythagorean_triplets([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])) # [(3, 4, 5), (6, 8, 10)]
```

<!-- $$\pagebreak$$ -->

## Problem 9 [10 points]

Write a Python decorator function that caches the output of a function. It should return the cached value if the function is called again with the same arguments. Provide an example usage of the decorator.

### Example

```python
def cache(func):
    pass

@cache
def fibonacci(n):
    pass

print(fibonacci(10)) # 55
print(fibonacci(10)) # 55 (this is a cached value)
```

## Problem 10 [10 points]

Write a Python decorator function that limits the number of times a function can be called. Provide an example usage of the decorator.

### Example

```python
def limit_calls(max_calls):
    pass

@limit_calls(3)
def greet():
    print("Hello world!")

greet() # Hello world!
greet() # Hello world!
greet() # Hello world!
greet() # Function `greet` can only be called 3 times.
```
