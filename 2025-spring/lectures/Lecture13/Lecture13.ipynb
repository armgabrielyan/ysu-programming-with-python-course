    "# Async programming with Async IO\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous programming** is a powerful paradigm for writing efficient, non-blocking code and Python's Async IO framework provides excellent tools for implementing it. Async IO is built around coroutines, event loops and the `async`/`await` syntax. The basic idea is to allow tasks to pause execution while waiting for slow operations (like network or file I/O), letting other tasks run during that wait time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Async IO is a *single-threaded, single-process design* that uses **cooperative multitasking**. This is a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes it from other concurrency models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single thread** - All code runs on a single thread, unlike threading or multiprocessing.   \n",
    "2. **Explicit yield points** - Tasks voluntarily yield control at `await` statements, allowing other tasks to run.\n",
    "3. **Non-preemptive** - The scheduler doesn't interrupt tasks; they must cooperate by yielding control.\n",
    "4. **Event loop coordination** - The event loop manages the scheduling of coroutines as they yield control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cooperative approach means tasks must be well-behaved - a task that performs CPU-intensive operations without yielding will block the entire event loop, preventing other tasks from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Async IO explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Async IO may at first seem counterintuitive and paradoxical. How does something that facilitates concurrent code use a single thread and a single CPU core? Miguel Grinberg’s 2017 PyCon talk explains everything quite beautifully:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Chess master Judit Polgár hosts a chess exhibition in which she plays multiple amateur players. She has two ways of conducting the exhibition: synchronously and asynchronously.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Assumptions:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - 24 opponents\n",
    "> - Judit makes each chess move in 5 seconds\n",
    "> - Opponents each take 55 seconds to make a move\n",
    "> - Games average 30 pair-moves (60 moves total)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Synchronous version:** Judit plays one game at a time, never two at the same time, until the game is complete. > Each game takes (55 + 5) * 30 == 1800 seconds, or 30 minutes. The entire exhibition takes 24 * 30 == 720 minutes, or *12 hours*.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Asynchronous version:** Judit moves from table to table, making one move at each table. She leaves the table and lets the opponent make their next move during the wait time. One move on all 24 games takes Judit 24 * 5 == 120 seconds, or 2 minutes. The entire exhibition is now cut down to 120 * 30 == 3600 seconds, or just *1 hour*. \n",

    "## Key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(Native) Coroutines**: Functions defined with `async def` that can be paused at `await` points to let other coroutines run and later be resumed.\n",
    "2. **Event loop**: The central execution mechanism that runs and manages coroutines.\n",
    "3. **Tasks**: Wrapped coroutines that run concurrently in the event loop.\n",
    "4. **Awaitables**: Objects that can be used with the `await` keyword (coroutines, Tasks, Futures)\n",

    "Async IO is built into `asyncio` library, which is to write concurrent code using the `async/await` syntax."
