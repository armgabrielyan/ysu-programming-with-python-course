    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `multiprocessing` module provides a way to create new processes using an API similar to the `threading` module. Unlike threads, it uses separate subprocesses, which allows it to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and take full advantage of multiple CPU cores. This enables true parallel execution and works on both POSIX systems and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to thread-like functionality, `multiprocessing` includes features not found in the `threading` module. One notable feature is the `Pool` class, which simplifies running a function in parallel across a collection of inputs—this is known as data parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "`multiprocessing.Process` objects represent activity that is run in a separate process. The `multiprocessing.Process` class has equivalents of all the methods of `threading.Thread`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if __name__ == '__main__'` part is necessary in multi-processing as you can see in the following example. This is to make sure that the main module can be safely imported by a new Python interpreter without causing unintended side effects (such as starting a new process).\n",

    "- **Pros:** Clean slate—only essential resources are inherited.\n",
    "- **Cons:** Slower startup.\n",
    "- **Default on:** **Windows** and **macOS**.\n",

    "- **Deprecated** for multi-threaded environments since Python 3.12 because forking a multi-threaded process is problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`forkserver`**\n",
    "- **How it works:** Starts a **server** process which handles forking. As it is single-threaded, it is safer to use `fork` method.\n",
    "- **Pros:** Safer than `fork`, faster than `spawn`. No excess resources inherited.\n",
    "- **Cons:** Requires OS support for file descriptor passing.\n",

    "- **Kernel-managed buffer:** The operating system manages a buffer for the pipe. If the writer produces data faster than the reader consumes it, the data accumulates in the buffer. If the buffer fills up, the writer will block (wait) until the reader consumes some data. Conversely, if the reader tries to read from an empty pipe, it will block until the writer sends data.\n",

    "- **Many-to-Many:** Often, multiple processes can write to the same queue, and multiple processes can read from it (though often a message is consumed by only one reader).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you use `JoinableQueue` then you must call `JoinableQueue.task_done()` for each task removed from the queue or else the semaphore used to count the number of unfinished tasks may eventually overflow, raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference from other Python queue implementations, is that `multiprocessing` queues serializes all objects that are put into them using `pickle`. The object return by the `get` method is a re-created object that does not share memory with the original object.\n",
