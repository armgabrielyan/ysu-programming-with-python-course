## Problem set 1

1. Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as an input and checks if the number is prime or composite.
2. Write a Python program that takes a number as an input and outputs the sum of all the digits in the number.
3. Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as an input and checks if the number is palindrome or not.
4. Write a Python program that takes two positive integers as an input and outputs their greatest common divisor.
5. Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as an input and outputs its binary representation.

## Problem set 2

1. Write a Python guessing game program where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between $1$ and $100$. The program will give hints after each guess whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.
2. The Maclaurin series of the exponential function $e^x$ is as follows:

$$e ^ x = 1 + x + \frac{x ^ 2}{2!} + \frac{x ^ 3}{3!} + \dots + \frac{x ^ n}{n!}$$

Write a Python program that takes a positive integer $n$ and a real value number $x$ as an input, and approximates the value of $e ^ x$.

3. The value of $\pi$ can be approximated by the following formula:

$$\pi = \sqrt{6 \times (1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{16} + \dots + \frac{1}{n ^ 2})}$$

Write a Python program that takes a positive integer $n$ as an input and approximates the value of $\pi$.

4. Write a Python program that takes a positive integer $n$ as an input and allows the user to enter $n$ integers. The program should display the maximum number in the sequence and the count of its occurrence.

5. Assume that $X$ is a random variable that follows the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, i.e. $X \sim B(n, p)$. Write a Python program that takes non-negative integers $n$ and $k$ as well as a real number $p$ as an input and outputs the probability of the random variable $X$ taking the value of $k$, i.e. $P(X = k)$.
