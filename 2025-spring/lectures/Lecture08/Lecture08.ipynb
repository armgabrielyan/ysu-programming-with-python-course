    "\n",
    "Python manages its own segment of memory called the **private heap**. All Python objects and data structures are stored in this private heap. The operating system manages the underlying virtual memory, but Python itself takes large chunks of memory from the OS and then manages the allocation of smaller pieces within those chunks for Python objects. Crucially, the Python interpreter itself manages this heap, meaning the memory isn't usually returned directly to the operating system when an object is deallocated. Instead, it's often kept available within the Python process for future object allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory management** is the process by which applications read and write data. A memory manager determines where to put an application’s data. Since there’s a finite chunk of memory, the manager has to find some free space and provide it to the application. This process of providing memory is generally called *memory allocation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere in the computer, there’s a physical device storing data when you’re running your Python programs. There are many layers of abstraction that the Python code goes through before the objects actually get to the hardware though. One of the main layers above the hardware (such as RAM or a hard drive) is the operating system (OS). It carries out (or denies) requests to read and write memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above the OS, there are applications, one of which is the default Python implementation. **Memory management for your Python code is handled by the Python application**. The default Python implementation, **CPython**, is actually written in the C programming language. It converts Python code into instructions that it then runs on a virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code actually gets compiled down to more computer-readable instructions called *bytecode*. These instructions get interpreted by a *virtual machine* when you run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so **CPython is written in C, and it interprets Python bytecode**. What does this have to do with memory management? Well, the memory management algorithms and structures exist in the CPython code, in C. To understand the memory management of Python, you have to get a basic understanding of CPython itself.\n",

So the design of the allocator is tuned to work well with small amounts of data at a time. It also tries not to allocate memory until it’s absolutely required.\n",

    "\n",
    "A `freepools` list keeps track of all the pools in the empty state. But when do empty pools get used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assume your code needs an 8-byte chunk of memory. If there are no pools in `usedpools` of the 8-byte size class, a fresh empty pool is initialized to store 8-byte blocks. This new pool then gets added to the `usedpools` list so it can be used for future requests**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say a full pool frees some of its blocks because the memory is no longer needed. That pool would get added back to the `usedpools` list for its size class.\n",

    "As seen in the diagram above, pools contain a pointer to their “free” blocks of memory. There’s a slight nuance to the way this works. This allocator “strives at all levels (arena, pool, and block) never to touch a piece of memory until it’s actually needed,” according to the comments in the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that a pool can have blocks in 3 states. These states can be defined as follows:\n",
    "- **untouched**: a portion of memory that has not been allocated\n",
    "- **free**: a portion of memory that was allocated but later made “free” by CPython and that no longer contains relevant data\n",
    "- **allocated**: a portion of memory that actually contains relevant data\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `freeblock` pointer points to a singly linked list of free blocks of memory. In other words, a list of available places to put data. If more than the available free blocks are needed, the allocator will get some untouched blocks in the pool**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the memory manager makes blocks “free,” those now free blocks get added to the front of the freeblock list. The actual list may not be contiguous blocks of memory, like the first nice diagram. It may look something like the diagram below:\n",

    "Arenas contain pools. Those pools can be used, full, or empty. Arenas themselves don’t have as explicit states as pools do though.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arenas are instead organized into a doubly linked list called `usable_arenas`. The list is sorted by the number of free pools available. The fewer free pools, the closer the arena is to the front of the list**.\n",

    "This means that the arena that is the most full of data will be selected to place new data into. But why not the opposite? Why not place data where there’s the most available space?\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the idea of truly freeing memory. The reason is that when a block is deemed “free”, that memory is not actually freed back to the operating system. The Python process keeps it allocated and will use it later for new data. Truly freeing memory returns it to the operating system to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arenas are the only things that can truly be freed. So, it stands to reason that those arenas that are closer to being empty should be allowed to become empty. That way, that chunk of memory can be truly freed, reducing the overall memory footprint of your Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How They Work Together**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Allocation**: When a new object needs to be created, CPython first determines the size class of the object. It then looks for a pool that handles objects of that size. If there is an available block within the pool, it is allocated to the object. If not, a new pool may be created within an arena, or a new arena may be allocated if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deallocation**: When an object is no longer needed and is to be destroyed, its block is deallocated and returned to the pool for reuse. This process is managed by the Python garbage collector, which also handles detecting and collecting cyclic references that cannot be freed by reference counting alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>The use of arenas reduces the number of system calls for memory allocation, as a single large block is requested from the operating system less frequently than many small blocks would be. This bulk allocation strategy reduces overhead and fragmentation at the OS level.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>By segregating objects into size classes, pools help to minimize internal fragmentation (unused space within allocated memory areas). This also allows for rapid allocation and deallocation of objects, as a pool can quickly find a free block without having to search or fit different-sized objects.</mark>\n",

    "### Garbage collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Garbage collection (GC)** is nothing but collecting or gaining memory back which has been allocated to objects but which is not currently in use in any part of our program. It is the process in which programs try to free up memory space that is no longer used by objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection is implemented differently for every language. Most high-level programming languages have some sort of garbage collection built in. Low-level programming languages may add garbage collection through libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C programming, developers need to take care of memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc()` and `free()` functions. But, in the case of C# developers don't need to take care of GC and it’s not recommended either. In C/C++ the developer must manually delete objects and free up memory. Relying on manual processes made it easy to introduce bugs into the code, some of which can have serious consequences. For example, a developer might forget to free up memory after the program no longer needs it, leading to a **memory leak** that quickly consumes all the available RAM. Or the developer might free up an object's memory space without modifying a corresponding pointer, resulting in a **dangling pointer** that causes the application to be buggy or even to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages that include garbage collection try to eliminate these types of bugs by using carefully designed GC algorithms to control memory deallocation. The garbage collector automatically detects when an object is no longer needed and removes it, freeing up the memory space allocated to that object without affecting objects that are still being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tracing\n",
    "Tracing garbage collection is the predominant form of garbage collection, to the extent that the term \"garbage collection\" is frequently synonymous with this method rather than alternatives like reference counting. The fundamental approach involves identifying objects for garbage collection by tracing a path of references from specific root objects to determine which ones are accessible. Objects not reachable in this way are deemed garbage and are subsequently collected. Nonetheless, the actual implementation of this strategy varies significantly, employing numerous algorithms that differ greatly in their complexity and performance traits.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:840/1*GN770FzmaWwTVdx94GneHQ.gif\" alt=\"Index\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reference counting\n",
    "Reference counting garbage collection is where each object has a count of the number of references to it. Garbage is identified by having a reference count of zero. An object's reference count is incremented when a reference to it is created, and decremented when a reference is destroyed. When the count reaches zero, the object's memory is reclaimed.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://book.huihoo.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-with-object-oriented-design-patterns-in-java/html/img1704.gif\" alt=\"Index\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with there are a few problems that need to be addressed:\n",
    "- **Cycles:** If two or more objects refer to each other, they can create a cycle whereby neither will be collected as their mutual references never let their reference counts become zero. Some garbage collection systems using reference counting (like the one in CPython) use specific cycle-detecting algorithms to deal with this issue.\n",
    "- **Space overhead (reference count):** Reference counting requires space to be allocated for each object to store its reference count. The count may be stored adjacent to the object's memory or in a side table somewhere else, but in either case, every single reference-counted object requires additional storage for its reference count. Memory space with the size of an unsigned pointer is commonly used for this task, meaning that **32 or 64 bits of reference count storage must be allocated for each object**. On some systems, it may be possible to mitigate this overhead by using a tagged pointer to store the reference count in unused areas of the object's memory. Often, an architecture does not actually allow programs to access the full range of memory addresses that could be stored in its native pointer size; certain number of high bits in the address is either ignored or required to be zero.\n",
    "- **Space overhead (increment/decrement):** In naive implementations, each assignment of a reference and each reference falling out of scope often require modifications of one or more reference counters. However, in a common case when a reference is copied from an outer scope variable into an inner scope variable, such that the lifetime of the inner variable is bounded by the lifetime of the outer one, the reference incrementing can be eliminated. The outer variable \"owns\" the reference.\n",
    "- **Atomicity:** When used in a multithreaded environment, these modifications (increment and decrement) may need to be atomic operations such as compare-and-swap, at least for any objects which are shared, or potentially shared among multiple threads. Atomic operations are expensive on a multiprocessor, and even more expensive if they have to be emulated with software algorithms. It is possible to avoid this issue by adding per-thread or per-CPU reference counts and only accessing the global reference count when the local reference counts become or are no longer zero (or, alternatively, using a binary tree of reference counts, or even giving up deterministic destruction in exchange for not having a global reference count at all), but this adds significant memory overhead and thus tends to be only useful in special cases (it is used, for example, in the reference counting of Linux kernel modules).\n",
    "- **Real-time:** Naive implementations of reference counting do not generally provide real-time behavior, because any pointer assignment can potentially cause a number of objects bounded only by total allocated memory size to be recursively freed while the thread is unable to perform other work. It is possible to avoid this issue by delegating the freeing of unreferenced objects to other threads, at the cost of extra overhead."

    "Python allows you to inspect the current reference count of an object with the `sys` module. You can use `sys.getrefcount(numbers)`, but keep in mind that passing in the object to `getrefcount()` increases the reference count by 1. See the implementation of `get_num_refs` function above.\n",
    "> Initially, you have your reference to `numbers`. When you pass numbers to `sys.getrefcount(numbers)`, `sys.getrefcount()` creates a temporary reference to `numbers` for the duration of the function call. This is why the reference count appears to increase by 1.\n",
    "After the `sys.getrefcount()` call, the temporary reference created by the function is removed.\n",

    "### The `gc` module\n",
    "The `gc` (garbage collector) package in Python is a module that provides an interface to the garbage collection facility in the Python interpreter. Its primary role is to manage the automatic memory management of Python objects, particularly focusing on the detection and collection of cyclic garbage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In general, you do not need to manually interact with the garbage collector**. Python's automatic garbage collection is sufficient for most applications. However, in memory-critical applications or when dealing with large data sets, manual control can be beneficial to optimize performance or to debug.\n",

    "In some scenarios, especially in a multithreaded environment where the garbage collection might introduce unwanted pauses, developers might choose to disable the automatic garbage collection and manually trigger it at more convenient times.\n",
